##PID OLD VERSIONS (DA INCREMENTARE IL PID QUANDO DIVENTA VECCHIO. AGGIORNARE IL PID DA 0 A 1 AD ESEMPIO)
execute as @a[scores={Voidblock_pid_1_mc1212=-100..}] run scoreboard players set @a Voidblock_pid_0_mc1212 1
execute as @a[scores={Voidblock_pid_1_mc1212=-100..}] run scoreboard players set @a Voidblock_pid_0_mc1212 1
execute as @a[scores={Voidblock_pid_1_mc1212=-100..}] run scoreboard players set @a Voidblock_pid_0_mc1212 1


##PID OLD UPDATE (INCREMENTARE I PID VECCHI: ogni 3 versioni e poi l'ultima, la 4, diventa incompatibile, quindi da sostituire. PRENDERE IN "update_pid" PER TENERE LA COMPATIBILITA, MANTENERE TUTTO IN LTS)
execute as @a[scores={Voidblock_pid_0_mc1212=1..}] run scoreboard players add @a PID_old_v1 1
execute as @a[scores={Voidblock_pid_0_mc1212=1..}] run scoreboard players add @a PID_old_v2 1

##PID OLD REMOVE (INCREMENTARE SOLO QUANDO E FINITO UN PID VECCHIO. INCREMENTARE SOLO QUANDO E FINITO E AGGIORNARE IL CONTATORE)
